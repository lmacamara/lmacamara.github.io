#### About me

Hello! I’m a Brazilian political science master’s student from Belém, Pará, residing in São Paulo for the past ten years. My research so far has focused on contemporary brazilian politics in comparative perspective, especially pre-electoral coordination in the context of the country's multi-level electoral politics. That research has led me to more questions than answers, which is why in the future I'm looking foward to study questions of political development in Latin America. In my spare time I cycle, run, and get ready for the 2022 application cycle. Feel free to contact me at lucas[dot]camara[at]usp[dot]br
